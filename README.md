# Lunar Lander Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning

![Lunar Lander](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12345678/INSERT_YOUR_IMAGE_URL_HERE)

This repository contains the code and implementation for training a Lunar Lander agent using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning algorithm. The agent learns to control a lunar lander to safely land on the moon's surface by deciding between four possible actions: do nothing, fire the right engine, fire the left engine, or fire the main engine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6+)
- Gym (OpenAI's Gym)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (or any other deep learning framework of your choice)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install gym numpy tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lunar-lander.git
cd lunar-lander
```

2. Train the DQN agent
This will start the training process for the Lunar Lander using the Deep Q-Network algorithm. You can adjust the hyperparameters in the `lunar_lander.ipynb` file to experiment with different settings.

3. Watch the agent in action
This will load the trained model and run the agent in the environment, displaying its performance.

4. Save a video of the agent's performance
This will save a video file of the agent's landing attempts.

## Configuration

You can modify the training parameters in the `lunar_lander.ipynb` file. This includes settings such as the learning rate, discount factor, and the number of training episodes.

## Files
- `utils.py`: Notebook containing helper functions.
- `lunar_lander_model.h5`: Deep Q-Network model.
- `lunar_lander.mp4`: mp4 video for the test result.
- `lunar_lander.ipynb`: Notebook containing the main code.

## Results

You can find the trained model weights and the saved video in the `main` directory.
